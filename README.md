# ViaThinkSoft Indexer Suite

The ViaThinkSoft Indexer Suite is a program that makes it possible to index a file system and map it to a SQL database. Various evaluations can then take place, e.g. searching for duplicates, verifying the integrity of the data in a further run, determining redundant directories, or offline browsing through the file system root while the original medium is offline.
